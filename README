GitHub provides the ability to connect git commits with active stories on
pivotal. The goal of this project is to provide some simple git commit hooks
to help make this connection easier




### active_stories.py ###

active_stories.py is meant to be used as prepare-commit-msg for git. It
connects to pivotal, gets all the stories that match your provided filter, and
adds the story numbers to the git commit. 

These stories are added in the form:

[#<NUMBER> #<NUBMER>] for each story number matching your filter. 


SET UP:
In order to setup your repository to work with this script, you need to
perform the following steps:

1) Install GitPython:
sudo easy_install gitpython


2) Create the following local git settings:
git config --local pivotal.token 'YOUR PIVOTAL ACCESS TOKEN'
git config --local pivotal.filter 'YOUR FILTER' 
git config --local pivotal.projectid 'YOUR PROJECT ID'

An example filter is:

mywork:AA current_state:started 

Where AA is your initials in the pivotal system. This filter will return all
stories that you are working on that are in a started state. 

3) Make sure git can get your path. On my Mac OS X system I needed to create a
symbolic link:

sudo ln -s /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages

4) copy the file to "<REPOSITORY_BASE>/.git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg" and make
it executable. 


After the setup every time you create a commit the script will run and prepend
the ticket numbers to your commit message.
